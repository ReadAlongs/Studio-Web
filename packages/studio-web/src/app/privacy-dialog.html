    We have built this tool with the top goal of respecting your privacy and
    data sovereignty. The audio that you use on this site
    <b>does not get uploaded anywhere</b>. It will stay on your computer. The
    text you use for this Read Along will be uploaded over an encrypted
    connection to a server for preprocessing. The text is not saved and is not
    used for any other purpose. Using this site means that you agree for your
    data to be used in this way.
  </p>
  <p i18n="Text for analytics">
    Almost every website you visit will collect data about you using Web
    Analytics tools which can come with a variety of privacy concerns. We have
    opted to use
    <a target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io">Plausible Analytics</a>,
    which incurs a cost for us but ensures that the data gathered about your
    visit here is not sold and respects your privacy. We use this data to
    determine how many people access the site, which devices they use, and other
    metrics used to make improvements to the site. For a full list of what is
    collected, please view
    <a target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io/data-policy"
      >Plausible's data policy</a
    >. For a less jargon-y example of the kind of data we see, you can visit
    this
    <a target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io/plausible.io"
      >demonstration site here</a
    >. In any case, you can opt out entirely by clicking the "Opt Out" button
    below (you can always opt back in later).
