This WordPress plugin allows the deployment and activation of a Read-Along generated using https://github.com/ReadAlongs/ on WordPress sites.


== Description ==

This plugin is a free service (no account required) for activating the &lt;read-along&gt; tag in a WordPress site. The source code of the scripts used to activate the  &lt;read-along&gt; tag is https://github.com/ReadAlongs/Studio-Web/.
This plugin will help you deploy and activate a Read-Along generated using **Studio-Web** or **Studio-CLI** from https://github.com/ReadAlongs/ on your WordPress site.
Please copy and paste the HTML code from the WordPress deployment section of the readme.txt generated by our studio application. Alternatively, just wrap your `<read-along>` in a WordPress shortcode `[read_along_web_app_loader]`.
